Welcome to LMMS's LoMMuS repository. **LoMMuS** is our Discord bot formerly operated and developed by [StakeoutPunch](https://github.com/StakeoutPunch), it is now maintained by the larger LMMS developers.

**Read the [wiki](https://github.com/LMMS/lommus/wiki) for instructions on how to set up and deploy LoMMuS.**

Feel free to contribute and make PRs.

The old README is located in [README.old.md](README.old.md), which displays notes and commands available at the time.

## Developing

The bot uses standard NodeJS APIs and is intended to run normally everywhere using any Node-like runtimes like Deno and Bun. You may use other runtimes/package managers while developing LoMMuS, just make sure to ensure compatibility with standard NodeJS.

### TypeScript

This repository uses TypeScript :D
